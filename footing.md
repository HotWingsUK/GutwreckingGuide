# Footing

_First, a warning..._

Footing (over the heel at least) is very difficult and is not for beginners to attempt. And even for anal experts it's an extreme and risky play.

Toes are not as flexible or as sensitive as fingers, and are more likely to cause injury. Be warned!

## Prep tips for the top

- **Toenails.** Make sure your toenails are super trimmed down, completely. File the edges super smooth and rounded. You do not, definitely, do not want any sharp bit to catch inside.
- **Stretches.** Make sure your ankle and calf are warmed up and really flexible and supple.
- **Clean & Cover up.** Feet and toes can be a home for all sorts of funky fauna. Give them a good scrub, and also use an extra thick condom over your foot. It helps smooth things out and also helps prevent bugs. Put this on at the last moment when you're already in place so you aren't walking around beforehand on it.
- **Warm Up the bottom** Make sure the bottom is super warmed up, pumped full of lube, and very loose already. I'd say you should be easily double-punch fisting them before attempting this. And you need a good "cavity" inside to be able to position the toes into.

## Prep tips for the bottom

- **Have a huge hole already!** Footing is not something you do to stretch your hole. You should be already stretched using toys, fists etc before attempting taking a foot. A foot is less flexible, it's harder, and more awkward than toys. And it's also not an ideal shape for gradually stretching out. The heel is quite abrupt - tapered toys are better. Use them regularly until you're already good and loose inside.
- **Find the right top.** This sort of risky play is not safe to do with someone who won't be able to 100% read and respect your body and verbal signals. They need to be patient, take it slow, and not to push you further than you can go. If they have small, nimble, ballet dancer feet, then that's a bonus also :)
- **Prepare to fail.** Don't be disheartened if it doesn't work out. Sometimes the hole isn't in the mood, or the angles aren't right, or whatever. Just chill and try again another time.

## Positioning

The best success I've had is heel to the tailbone. So you can either both go on all fours, or as I would recommend, both lie down on a big bed.

You want the heel to go slightly to one side of the tailbone, so play with it to the left and right and see what works best for the bottom.

## Insertion
Ballet toes! Point the foot as much as you can. You want it as flat as possible.

Go super slow. Don't make any sudden movements.

Never try to reposition yourself while inside! Pull out first then reposition yourself if need be.

Be warned that once the heel breaches the sphincter there will be a sudden pull, make sure the toes are aligned with the direction of the rectum before this happens.

## Once inside
Don't thrust or jerk. Super slow pressure is the way in, and once inside, hold it there. The pressure and intense feeling alone will be enough for sure.

Don't try and "fuck" with your foot, it is too risky that the alignment will go out of place and you will cause injury - either an internal tear with your tows or to the tailbone with your heel.

## Carefully does it!
This is definitely one of those situations where the bottom is leading, but equally if you/they're subby don't let them get over-enthusiastic. Take your time. Read the bottom's body signals even if they aren't vocalising. 100% present, 100% alert from both the bottom and top.

### Best of luck!
